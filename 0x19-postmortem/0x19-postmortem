stmortem: Service Outage on May 11, 2024

Issue Summary:
Duration: The outage occurred from 14:00 to 16:30 UTC.
Impact: The outage affected the availability of our core service, leading to a 30% reduction in user access. Users experienced slow response times and intermittent errors during the outage.
Root Cause: The outage was caused by a database server failure due to disk I/O saturation.
Timeline:
14:00 UTC: Issue detected through monitoring alerts indicating unusually high latency.
14:05 UTC: Engineering team notified and began investigation, suspecting a potential network issue.
14:20 UTC: Further investigation revealed disk I/O saturation on the database server as the likely cause.
14:30 UTC: Misleading investigation paths included exploring network configurations and potential DDoS attacks.
14:45 UTC: Incident escalated to senior engineering team for additional support.
15:30 UTC: Database server issue identified and resolved by reallocating I/O-intensive processes and optimizing database queries.
16:30 UTC: Service fully restored, and latency returned to normal levels.
Root Cause and Resolution:
Root Cause: The root cause of the outage was identified as disk I/O saturation on the database server, resulting in degraded performance and service unavailability.
Resolution: The issue was resolved by reallocating I/O-intensive processes to alternative servers, optimizing database queries to reduce I/O load, and implementing additional monitoring to detect and prevent similar incidents in the future.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:
Improvements/Fixes:
Optimize database indexing and query performance to reduce I/O load.
Implement automated scaling for database resources to handle sudden spikes in traffic.
Enhance monitoring alerts for early detection of disk I/O saturation and other performance bottlenecks.
Tasks to Address the Issue:
Implement database performance optimizations by end of week (Task assigned to Database Engineering team).
Configure automated scaling policies for database servers by end of month (Task assigned to DevOps team).
Enhance monitoring alerts for disk I/O saturation by next release cycle (Task assigned to Monitoring and Alerting team).
